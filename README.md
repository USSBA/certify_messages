# CertifyMessages

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/certify_messages`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

This is a thin wrapper for the [Certify Messaging API](https://github.com/SBA-ONE/message-api) to handle basic GET and POST operations for both conversations/threads and messages.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'certify_messages'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install certify_messages
